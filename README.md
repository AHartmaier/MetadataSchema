# Metadata Schema for Microstructure-Sensitive Mechanical Data

A novel metadata schema has been introduced to address the sparsity of microstructure-sensitive mechanical data. This schema was designed following the material modeling workflow, where each run of the workflow results in the creation of unique data objects. The schema includes various categorical elements to ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of these data objects.
